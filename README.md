A minimal **sudo-like privilege elevation tool for Linux**, written in **Ruby,** **Python + C**  
with **PAM authentication** and **system-wide secure password caching**.

Syca acts as a clean, lightweight alternative to sudo/doas while keeping strict  
security boundaries. Authentication is performed via PAM, and a secure C setuid helper  
executes privileged commands safely.

## ✨ Features

- **🔒 Authentication Cache**

Syca stores authentication securely using a root-owned state file accessed
through the setuid helper. Once authenticated, you won’t be prompted again until
the cache expires.

- 🔐 **PAM-based password authentication**
- 🕒 **System-wide privilege cache** (shared across all terminals)
- 👥 User must be added to **group wheel** to be authorized.
- ⚙️ **Execute commands as root:**
```bash
syca <command>
```


- ⏱ **Temporary root access** via privilege cache:
- Enable root access for a limited time:
```bash
syca --enable <minutes>
```

- Disable the temporary root access manually:
```bash
syca --disable
```
- Check the current status of the root access cache:
```bash
syca --status
```

## 🚀 Usage

Run any command as root via Syca:

Update system packages
```bash
syca pacman -Syu
```
Restart a system service
```bash
syca systemctl restart NetworkManager
```

Edit a root-owned file
```bash
syca vim /etc/hosts
```
